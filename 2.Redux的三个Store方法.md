## store的三个方法

1. `getState()` retrieves the current state of the Redux store. If we ran `console.log(store.getState())` with the code above, we could get `0` since it is the initial state of our application.

2. `dispatch()` is the most commonly used. It is how we dispatch actions to change the state of the application. If we run `store.dispatch( { type: 'INCREMENT' });` followed by `console.log(store.getState());` we will get `1`, which reflects the current state resulting from the INCREMENT action.

3. `subscribe()` registers a callback that the redux store will call any time an action has been dispatched so you can update the UI of your application to reflect the current application state.
